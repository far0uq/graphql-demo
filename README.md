# GraphQL Demo
You can get games, reviews for the games and details about the authors of those reviews. 

Just me fumbling through GraphQL so I donâ€™t get left behind like Blockbuster. It runs. 

```bash
npm install 
nodemon index.js
```

Hit [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) and hope for the best.
